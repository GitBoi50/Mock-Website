    <p>
        <h3>Crust Ingredients:</h3>
            3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, or more as needed
            <br>
            2 (.25 ounce) envelopes FLEISCHMANN'S速 Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise速 Yeast
            <br>
            1 tablespoon sugar
            <br>
            1 1/2 teaspoons salt
            <br>
            1 1/3 cups very warm water (120 degrees F to 130 degrees F)
            <br>
            1/3 cup oil
        <h3>Topping Ingredients:</h3>  
            1 (6 ounce) package HORMEL速 Pepperoni
            <br>
            1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste  
        <h3>Sauce Ingredients:</h3>
            1/2 (12 ounce) can CONTADINA速 Tomato Paste
            <br>
            1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed
            <br>
            1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed
            <br>
            1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
            <br>
            1/2 teaspoon onion powder
            <br>
            1/2 teaspoon sugar
            <br>
            1/2 teaspoon salt
            <br>
            1/4 teaspoon black pepper
        <h3>Cooking Instructions:</h3>
            1.For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .
            <br>
            2.For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.
            <br>
            3.Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise(R) Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)
            <br>
            4.Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.
            <br>
            5.For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.
            <br>
            6.Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.
            <br>
            This yields: 1 pizza , about 12 slices.
